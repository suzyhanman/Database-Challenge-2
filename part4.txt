
1. Indexing
	Create indexes for frequently queried data
2. Review Schema Design
	Evaluate Embedding vs. Referencing: 
		Reassess schema design to ensure optimal performance. Look into embedding frequently accessed related data to reduce the need for joins. 
3. Optimizing Queries:
	Analyzing query patterns using explain() method 
	Avoiding large number of documents being returned by using $limit and $skip
	Use projection to limit number of fields returned
